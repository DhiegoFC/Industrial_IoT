### Industrial IoT

#### Objectives:

* Understand the fundamental principles of IoT and LoRaWAN in the OSI Model Stack context.
* Configure and program LoRaWAN devices to transmit messages to The Things Network (TTN) and/or ChirpStack.
* Integrate devices with sensors for environmental data collection and send them to the LoRaWAN servers.
* Implement MQTT communication for real-time data ingestion.
* Visualize and analyze data using Node-RED, MongoDB, and Grafana.
